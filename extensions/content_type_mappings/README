Content Type Mappings
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 30th April 2009
Requirements: Latest Symphony Integration code.

Allows more control over Frontend page content type mappings. Each mapping is 
stored in the Symphony config file, and page type is matched against these mappings.


[INSTALLATION]

	* You must be running the latest Symphony code from the git Integration branch *

	1. Enable the extension
	2. Add content type mappings to your /manifest/config.php file with 
	   the format 'TYPE' => 'CONTENT-TYPE', E.G.:

			###### CONTENT-TYPE-MAPPINGS ######
			'content-type-mappings' => array(
				'xml' => 'text/xml; charset=utf-8',
				'text' => 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
			),
			########

	3. If a page uses a type listed in the config, that appropriate content type will
	   be set. Should more than one match be found, the last one encountered will be
	   used.
